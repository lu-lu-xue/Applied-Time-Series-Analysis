**Lecture Notes**
---

Will be distributed chapter-wise in advance. Please check carefully for typos and mistakes and submit a list of what you found for potential extra credit. The notes will be uploaded continuously with your input. 

**Optional Textbooks**
---
Brockwell/Davis, *Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting (2nd ed.)*, Springer, 2002.

Cowpertwait/Metcalfe, *Introductory Time Series with R*, Springer, 2009.

Shumway/Stoffer, *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications (3rd ed.)*, Springer, 2011.

*Note that the second and third book are available as pdf files from the library website.*

**Prerequisite**
---
STA 108, or the equivalent.

*Note that STA 130A or STA 131A have proved useful in the past but are not required.*

**Topics (tentative)**
---
* Decomposition of time series into trend, seasonality and dependent errors
* Modeling of dependent errors: stationarity, linear time series, ARMA processes
* Estimation and prediction of stationary time series
* Spectral analysis: cyclical behavior, periodicity and periodogram

**Learning Outcomes**
----
Students taking STA 137 should learn the basics of
* statistical reasoning and inferential methods for dependent data
* time series analysis in the time and frequency domain
* interpreting and communicating the results of a statistical analysis for time series
* performing data analysis for time series using statistical computing tools and software
* the methodological and probabilistic foundations of statistics for dependent data

<!-- **Grading Policy**
---
Grades will be computed according to the following arrangements
<pre>  Midterm exam: 35%  Final exam: 40%  Project: 25% of final grade</pre>

&nbsp; Midterm exam: 35% &nbsp;  Final exam: 40% &nbsp;  Project: 25% of final grade

  
  * A: between 90 and 100% (the A range will not be curved)
  * B: between class median and 89% (above average performance gives above average grade)
  * C: between class median minus 1.5 standard deviations and class median
  * D: between class median minus 2.0 standard deviations and class median minus 1.5 standard deviations
  * F: less than class median minus 2.0 standard deviations

*Note that no individual letter grades will be given for midterm/final exams and project. Your letter grade for the
course will be based on your overall score. The usual conventions apply regarding the use of “+” and “-”.* -->
